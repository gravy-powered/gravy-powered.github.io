Personal info:


 <p id="aboutme"> Born and raised in St. Louis Missouri, I've been fascinated by computers for most of my life. What started as making animations in Microsoft PowerPoint eventually evolv
            ed into a love of designing games and programming as a whole. Since graduating high school I’ve studied Computer Engineering at the University of Iowa with plans to graduate in 2023. Some other interests I have include art of any kind, listening to and producing music, and engaging in community activities.
